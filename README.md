# AI Code Iterator

## Core Problem

Developers spend significant time on repetitive tasks like writing boilerplate code, refactoring for readability, and ensuring code quality. This leads to reduced productivity and increased risk of errors.  Existing code completion tools often lack context awareness and personalization.

## The Solution

The AI Code Iterator solves this by providing intelligent, context-aware code suggestions and automated refactoring capabilities.  It learns the developer's coding style and project context to offer highly personalized and relevant suggestions, going beyond simple autocomplete.  It also suggests relevant tests to ensure code quality. This significantly improves developer productivity and reduces the likelihood of errors.

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Scaffolding (Week 1)
- Set up the project repository and development environment.
- Implement core data structures for code representation and storage.
- Integrate a suitable machine learning model for code analysis and suggestion generation (e.g., a pre-trained model fine-tuned on a relevant code dataset).

### Phase 2: Core Logic Implementation (Week 2)
- Develop the core algorithm for code suggestion and iteration.
- Implement functionality for code analysis, including syntax checking, style analysis, and potential bug detection.
- Build initial integration with a code editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code extension).

### Phase 3: User Interface & Experience (Week 3)
- Design and implement a user-friendly interface for interacting with the tool.
- Develop features for managing code history and comparing different iterations.
- Incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggestions.

### Phase 4: Integration, Testing & Polish (Week 4)
- Thoroughly test the tool's functionality and performance.
- Refactor the codebase for maintainability and scalability.
- Prepare documentation and a user guide.
